# Deep Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project is a curated collection of my labs, exercises, and projects from my deep learning course. It's built using Jupyter Book and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## ‚ú® About This Project

This portfolio serves as a demonstration of my journey and understanding of key deep learning concepts, including:

- **Neural Network Fundamentals:** Building models from scratch, implementing forward and backward passes.
- **Deep Learning with PyTorch:** Using Tensors, building models with `nn.Module`, and training with standard optimizers and loss functions.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Implementing training loops and visualizing model performance.
- **Data Manipulation:** Using NumPy and PyTorch for essential tensor operations.
