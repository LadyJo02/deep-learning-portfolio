### 🎬 Reaction Paper

Honestly, watching the WIRED documentary *“Living in the Age of AI”* made me realize that AI isn’t just some sci-fi concept from the movies — it’s already here, shaping our lives in ways I hadn’t really thought about. The film left me feeling both hopeful and a little bit worried. It showed how AI can transform industries, save lives, and improve accessibility, but also raised serious questions about privacy, job loss, and misinformation.

The real-world examples were inspiring: AI detecting skin cancer as accurately as doctors, the “Seeing AI” app helping blind people, and even young innovators like Bishop J using AI for medical research. These moments made AI feel deeply human — not just about data, but about compassion and empowerment.

However, the film also warned of challenges. Automation could replace jobs, and deepfakes could make truth itself harder to trust. That’s why the documentary emphasized the need to “set the rules right” — to combine innovation with ethics, and education with responsibility.

In the end, it reminded me that the most important programming isn’t in code but in the **values** guiding our technology. The future of AI depends not only on what it can do, but on how we choose to use it.
